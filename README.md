# Doom-Engine-Java (3D Game engine)

A simple doom-like game engine. Here is video of presentation: [https://youtu.be/rdSWH_XKPg8](https://youtu.be/rdSWH_XKPg8).

## Description

This project is a basic implementation of a Doom-like game engine I made. It includes features such as 2D and 3D map rendering, BSP and player movement.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

To be able to run this program you will need at least JDK 21, here is one link to download it: [https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/downloads/](https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/downloads/)

And you will need to install the program itself: [jar file](https://github.com/RDel-Medico/Doom-Engine-Java/blob/main/doom.jar) in this repo.

### Executing Program

Once you have all the dependencies you simply have to execute the jar file via a terminal with the following command:

java -jar /path/to/file/doom.java

## Further Improvements

Here are some ideas for further improvements:

- Add a map editor
- Add monsters with AI to the game engine
- Save / Load system in the game
